# SQL-Project

In this project, I utilized SQL to dive deep into the pizzeria's operations, uncovering valuable insights that can drive better decision-making and optimization. From calculating total orders and revenue to identifying the most popular pizza sizes and the top-performing pizza types, this project showcases the power of data in transforming business operations. Key highlights include:

1. Total orders and revenue generation

2. Highest priced and most commonly ordered pizzas

3. Top 5 most ordered pizza types

4. Distribution of orders by time and category

5. Average daily pizza orders

6. Revenue contributions by pizza category
